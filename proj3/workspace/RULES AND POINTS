Rules

DCL:
50-cpp - Properly done - little confused about this one though, might have missed it
+20
51-cpp - Both header files are wrong, They use leading and trailing underscores.
+30
52-cpp - Properly done - no const or volatile
+20
53-cpp - Properly done - seems ambiguous of a description, but their functions are unambiguous
+20
54-cpp - N/A - never overloaded alloc or dealloc
+20
55-cpp - N/A - never passed class object accross a trust boundry
+20
56-cpp - N/A - did not use cycles to initialization
+20
57-cpp - Don't have exceptions, does a weird else {} statement that i haven't seen before.
+20
58-cpp - Properly done - doesn't modify std namespace
+20
59-cpp - Properly done - did not define unnamed namespace in header file
+20
60-cpp - N/A - obeyed the ODR
+20
30-C   - MineBoard line #71 might be a violation but i'm not sure
+20
40-C   - Properly done - didn't create imcompatible declarations of the same function or object
+20 

=270

MSC:
50-cpp - Uses rand() to generate psuedo random numbers, instead of accounting for distribution
+30
51-cpp - Doesn't seed random number generater, just uses rand()
+30
52-cpp - Doesn't return on all value's cuases a bunch of errors
-----
53-cpp - N/A - no [noreturn] functions
+20
54-cpp - N/A - no signal handlers
+20
33-C   - N/A - never used Asctime() function
+20
37-C   - Possibly done wrong - control is passed through many if functions without catches, 
         but if this rule only applies on functions that return then they did it right.
+20
38-C   - N/A - never used a predefined object if it might only be implemented as a macro
+20
39-C   - N/A - never used va_list
+20
40-C   - Properly done - never violated constraints
+20

= 200
Breaks:
Unless you give all the inputs the code seg faults on execution
    -Can input 4 args and they say it's wrong

    - 0 1 or 2 inputs seg faults
+100    

Seg faults on out of bounds (i.e. 10 x 10 board, 12 12 breaks it)
+100
allows for 0 bombs
when asking to play next game lets you input anything (not just y / n) and then exits
+100 ?

MSC52-cpp If you put characters instead of numbers for input it repeats forever
+100

MSC52-cpp characters count during initialization;
+100?

=300 + ?200?

Total = 770 + ?200?
