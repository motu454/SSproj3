Rules for ARR and EXP


EXP:
1. Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side effects
2. Do not access a volatile object through a nonvolatile reference.
3. Do not read uninitialized memory.
4. Do not dereference null pointers.
5. Do not cast pointers into more strictly aligned pointer types.
6. Call functions with the correct number and type of arguments.
7. Do not access a variable through a pointer of an incompatible type.
8. Do not modify constant objects.
9. Do not compare padding data.
10. Do not rely on side effects in operands to sizeof, _Alignof, or _Generic.
11. Do not perform assignments in selection statements.
12. Do not use a bitwise operator with a Boolean-like operand.
13. Do not call va_arg with an argument of the incorrect type.


ARR:
1. Ensure size arguments for variable length arrays are in a valid range.
2. Do not subtract or compare two pointers that do not refer to the same array.
3. Do not add or subtract a scaled integer to a pointer.
4. Guarantee that library functions do not form invalid pointers.
5. Do not subtract or compare two pointers that do not refer to the same array.
6. Do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts.
